Juliet is a interactive tutor for Julia that provides a simple yet powerful tutorial framework.
It is currently a Google Summer of Code project for the Julia Language.

Though development is at an early stage, please feel free to give feedback or advice. I am unable to test on all systems - if you have a problem, open an issue with your system details and steps to reproduce.

All code is released under the MIT license.


## Julia 0.5 Compatibility Issues

Currently not of Juliet's dependencies work in Julia 0.5. I have reached out to their maintainers, but cannot guarantee speedy updates. Should they remain incompatible for too long after 0.5's launch, I will endevor to find or create replacements.
